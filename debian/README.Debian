 == Installation of additional packages with goinstall ==

Debian's goinstall was modified to not install dependencies by
default, because it tries to recompile system libraries, which fails.
If you want to use goinstall you are probably better using golang-go
installed in your home, because goinstall is not very FHS friendly
now.
